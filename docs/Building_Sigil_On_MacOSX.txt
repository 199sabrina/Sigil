#         You will need to have CMake 3.0 or later installed and in your path
#
#         If you want to use official stock Qt then Make sure you have installed Qt 5.4.2 
#         or Qt 5.5.1 as you can not use stock Qt 5.6 as Qt has removed QtWebkit in Qt 5.6.
#
#         Alternatively, you can follow the Qt build instructions to add QtWebKit back 
#         to Qt 5.6.X and build Qt yourself directly from source.  This is what the official
#         Sigil builds now do.

# Mac OSX Yosemite users with XCode 6.3 should use the following cmake command:

# Mac OSX El Capitan and later users with XCode 7 who have copied in the MacOSX10.10sdk, should use the following cmake command:

# In ${MYSIGILREPO}/build/bin you will find a the newly built Sigil.app

# To test if the newly bundled python 3 version of Sigil is working properly ypou can do the following:

1. download testplugin_v013.zip from https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil/tree/master/docs
2. open Sigil.app to the normal nearly blank template epub it generates when opened
3. use Plugins->Manage Plugins menu and make sure the "Use Bundled Python" checkbox is checked
4. use the "Add Plugin" button to navigate to and add testplugin.zip and then hit "Okay" to exit the Manage Plugins Dialog
5. use Plugins->Edit->testplugins to launch the plugin and hit the "Start" button to run it
6. check the plugin output window for your missing or broken plugin test results
